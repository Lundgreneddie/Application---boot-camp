  <p>Pair Programming is a technique where two programmers help eachother and work together at one workstation. </br>
  Think of it as two pilots flying a plane, you have the captain who's stearing the plane, in this case the one writing the code,</br> while the "co-pilot" helps navigate and observe the code as it's written. </br> Using this technique can help improve team-building and communication between programmers and teams. </br>There is quite a few advantages with programming in pairs. For starters two heads are usually better than one, it's more efficient being able to focus on different</br> parts of the process at the same time. And it also enables programmers to share knowledge more easily.
